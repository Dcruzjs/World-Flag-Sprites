#World Flag Sprites

Basically, [the GoSquared flag icon set](https://www.gosquared.com/resources/flag-icons/) as sprites.

In other words, two different styles - "flat" and "shiny", each of them available in the following sizes:

* 16 x 16 px
* 24 x 14 px
* 32 x 32 px
* 48 x 48 px
* 64 x 64 px

In each folder, you'll find some CSS (you may need to change the URL to the image), the sprite itself and an HTML page as a quick & dirty demo.

The flag sprites have all been optimised using [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/).

Here's an example:
